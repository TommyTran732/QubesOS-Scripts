# QubesOS-Scripts
My scripts for setting up QubesOS. Read the scripts and adjust them to your needs, don't just blindly run them. Note that the scripts do not disable passwordless sudo. If you want to do it, follow https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vm-sudo/ and set it up on the Fedora and Debian templates before using my scripts. The purpose of this is to **hopefully** get a bit better protection against VM escapes (as an attacker would need to both get root privilege in the VM and exploit a bug in the Qubes agents or Xen hypervisor).
